Nemo
====
File Manager for Cinnamon

Nemo is the file manager for the Cinnamon desktop environment. 

----

WARNING: this git repo is a development version of Nemo.

- Only the file libnemo-private/nemo-file-operations.c is modified in the hope to improve the time estimation of the file transfers.
- Really, two other files are modified: this README.md and docs/algo_estimation_du_temps_de_transfert_de_fichiers.md, the latter is some comments in French about the change.
- I copied the comments on https://annuel.framapad.org/p/estimation_temps_copie ; I would really appreciate if you can give your thoughts about the method, possibly on the pad and/or by email/MP/Twitter/etc.
